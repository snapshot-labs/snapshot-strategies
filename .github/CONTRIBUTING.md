### Opening an issue

You should usually open an issue in the following situations:

* Report an error you can’t solve yourself
* Discuss a high-level topic or idea (for example, community, vision or policies)
* Propose a new feature or other project idea

Tips for communicating on issues:

* **If you see an open issue that you want to tackle,** comment on the issue to let people know you’re on it. That way, people are less likely to duplicate your work.
* **If an issue was opened a while ago,** it’s possible that it’s being addressed somewhere else, or has already been resolved, so comment to ask for confirmation before starting work.
* **If you opened an issue, but figured out the answer later on your own,** comment on the issue to let people know, then close the issue. Even documenting that outcome is a contribution to the project.

### Opening a pull request

You should usually open a pull request in the following situations:

* Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
* Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you’ve already discussed, in an issue

A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.

If the project is on GitHub, here’s how to submit a pull request:

* **Fork the repository** and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from this repository often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
* **Create a branch** for your edits.
* **Reference any relevant issues** or supporting documentation in your PR (for example, “Closes #37.”)
* **Include screenshots of the before and after** if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
* **Test your changes!** Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
* **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi-colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.
