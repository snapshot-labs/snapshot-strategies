# Snapshot strategies

### Development

#### Install dependencies
```bash
yarn
```

#### Build package
```bash
yarn build
```

#### Test strategy
*Note: If you're writing a new strategy, make sure to add it to strategies/index.ts before testing*
```bash
# Test default strategy (erc20-balance-of)
yarn test
# Test strategy with name
yarn test --strategy=erc20-received
yarn test --strategy=eth-balance
# Test with more addresses from addresses.json
yarn test --strategy=eth-balance --more=200
```

### Checklist for adding a new strategy

Here is a simple checklist to look when reviewing a PR for a new strategy:

**Overview**
- The strategy must be unique.
- If the strategy does only a single call with an address as input, it's preferable to use the strategy "contract-call" instead of creating a new one.

**Code**
- There should be a maximum of 5 requests, a request can use "fetch" a "subgraphRequest" or "multicall".
- The strategy should not send a request for each voters, this doesn't scale.
- The strategy PR should not add any dependency in Snapshot.js.
- The score returned by the strategy should use the same casing for address than on the input, or should return checksummed addresses.

**Example**
- Example must include at least 1 address with a positive score.
- Example must use a snapshot block number in the past.

**Test**
- The strategy should take less than 10sec to resolve.
- The strategy should work with 500 addresses. [Here is a list of addresses](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/blob/master/test/addresses.json).

**Recommended**
- Add a README.md file that describe the strategy and provide an example of parameters.
- Use string ABI instead of object.
