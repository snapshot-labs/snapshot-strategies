# API V2 Override strategy

Same as the `api-v2` strategy, but passes all voter addresses in the query string / body payload of the API endpoint.
Prefer `api-post` method for better scalability.

## Params

All params are same as the `api-v2` strategy.
Refer to the `api-v2` strategy's documentation for more details.
