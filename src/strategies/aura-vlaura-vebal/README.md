# aura-vlaura-vebal

This strategy returns proportional voting power for vlAURA holders based on system owned veBAL.

For example:
- there are 10000 vlAURA total supply
- a user has 2000 vlAURA (voting power, delegated to them)
- Aura's voterProxy owns 100k veBAL

In this example, the user has 20k veBAL voting power as they own 20% of the vlAURA voting power.

_Note: When depositing to the auraLocker, a user does not receive vlAURA until the next epoch has begun (Thursday at 00:00 UTC)_
