# ERC-721 with Delegate.xyz (V2) support

This enables Delegate.xyz users to vote from their delegate wallet while using ERC-721 NFTs from their cold wallet. Users can safely vote without the need to connect or sign using their cold wallet.

Delegate.xyz (V2) Full wallet and smart contract level delegation are both supported.

If a user has delegated access to multiple wallets, the most recent delegation will be calculated.

This strategy uses the same parameters as erc721-balance-of, but the signing wallet is now the delegate wallet.
