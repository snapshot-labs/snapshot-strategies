# nft-and-rep-flattened

A strategy where you can check to see if addresses have a specified balance of ERC721s and ERC1155s with multi-chain support.

Here is an example of parameters:

```json
{
  "erc721Address": "0x63f8F23ce0f3648097447622209E95A391c44b00",
  "erc1155Address": "0x57AA5fd0914A46b8A426cC33DB842D1BB1aeADa2",
  "erc721MinTokens": 1,
  "erc1155MinTokens": 10,
  "erc721NetworkId": "1",
  "erc1155NetworkId": "137"
}
```
