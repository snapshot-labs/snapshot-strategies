# erc721-contract-call

This is a strategy that calls a function on your NFT contract to retrieve the voting power for each token ID owned by an address

Here is an example of parameters:

```json
{
  "address": "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890", // Your NFT contract address
  "symbol": "xSGT",
  "decimals": 0
}
```
