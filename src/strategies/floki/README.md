# FLOKI

This is the strategy used by FLOKI DAO. It returns the FLOKI balance, as well as staked amount with pool's multiplier taken into account (which depends on how long the tokens were staked for).

Here is an example of parameters:

```json
{
  "tokenAddress": "0xcf0C122c6b73ff809C693DB761e7BaeBe62b6a2E",
  "stakingPoolAddress": "0xb8D2471E35eE033Db509e0456c8eFc4135f4EE43",
  "stakingPoolMultiplierAddress": "0xB254CC6c1D178C2dE8182CEDE6113A986bB90721",
  "decimals": 9
}
```
