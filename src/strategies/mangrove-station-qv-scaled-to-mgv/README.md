# mangrove-station-qv-scaled-to-mgv

This strategy allows active members of one of the Mangrove DAO governance groups (Builders Group and Pods Group) to vote in the Mangrove multistakeholder governance.

Quadratic voting is applied to each member's score and then the voting weight is scaled such that the total voting weight of the group is equal to the circulating supply of MGV tokens. This ensures that the three stakeholder groups have equal voting weights.

## Notes
Mangrove DAO governance groups are [Station](https://www.station.express/) [GroupOS](https://groupos.xyz/) groups on-chain, and active members have a ERC-1155 badge.

The circulating supply of MGV tokens is the total number of allocated, claimable tokens.
