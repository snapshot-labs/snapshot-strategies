# morpho-delegation

This strategy allows to get any address' voting power for tokens inheriting from Morpho Labs Delegation Token.
It sums the delegated assets plus the balance of the user (if not delegated)

Here is an example of parameters:

```json
{
  "address": "0x3CF66a662390e37ff260D0cBAa8Af6d426D60D43",
  "symbol": "MORPHO",
  "decimals": 18
}
```
