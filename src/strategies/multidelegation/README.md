# multidelegation

If you want to delegate your voting power to multiple wallet addresses, you can do this using the multidelegation strategy. This strategy is based on [delegation strategy](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/delegation) with the exception that you can delegate to several addresses at the same time.

If A delegates to B and C, A's score is split equally to B and C.
In case A already has previously delegated with the [delegation strategy](https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-strategies/tree/master/src/strategies/delegation), this multidelegation strategy will override it.

The multidelegation smart contract is in Polygon, so the gas fee to delegate is way lower ðŸ’¸.

| -------------------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| strategies                 | List of sub strategies to calculate voting power based on delegation                                                                                |
| delegationSpace (optional) | Get delegations of a particular space (by default it takes delegations of current space)                                                            |
| polygonChain (optional)    | Indicates the polygon subgraph to be used to fetch delegations. Possible values are `mumbai` and `mainnet` (by default it uses `mumbai`'s subgraph) |
