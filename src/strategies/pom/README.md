  # PoM strategy

  Each Proof Of Membership (PoM) is implemented as a non-transferable soulbound erc721.
  An address can have only 1 name in a community.
  This is the basic voting strategy for Proof Of Membership (PoM), which allows users with a name in a particular community to have 1 vote.

  Here is an example of parameters:
  ```json
  {
    "community": "beast",
  }
  ```
