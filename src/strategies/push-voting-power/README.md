# EPNS Governance: Voting

This strategy weighs the vote using:
- Amount of `$PUSH` delegated to user
- Amount of `$PUSH` staked in Push staking pool
- Amount of `$PUSH-LP` staked in LP staking pool

The voting power is calculated in terms of `$PUSH`, so `$PUSH-LP` tokens are converted to `$PUSH` using on chain data from Uniswap-V2 Router, WETH and USDT token contracts.
