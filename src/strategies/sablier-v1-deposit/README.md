# Deposit in Sablier Stream

In Sablier V1, a stream creator locks up an amount of ERC-20 tokens in a contract that progressively allocates the funds to the designated
recipient. The tokens are released by the second, and the recipient can withdraw them at any time.

This strategy returns the score for any voter as the sum of all deposits made by a sender towards the voters for a specific ERC20 token.

Here is an example of parameters:

```json
{
  "sender": "0xC9F2D9adfa6C24ce0D5a999F2BA3c6b06E36F75E",
  "token": "0x7f8F6E42C169B294A384F5667c303fd8Eedb3CF3"
}
```
