# Sablier V2 Strategies

In Sablier V2, the sender of a payment stream first deposits a specific amount of ERC-20 tokens in a contract. Then, the contract
progressively allocates the funds to the recipient, who can access them as they become available over time. The payment
rate is influenced by various factors, including the start and end times, as well as the total amount of tokens
deposited.

The strategies in this folder read the various amounts that can be found in Sablier V2 streams.
