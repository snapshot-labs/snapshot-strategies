### Getting started

- Check the template here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13aJrpOUtajyMLvmjvEqutnEP0FkuH3Z-LPH9m9Mbhis/edit?usp=sharing
- Select: File > Make a copy
- On the newly created file select: File > Share > Publish to web
- On the modal "Publish to web" click "Publish" button
- Copy the long id within the URL and use it as "sheetId" parameter for the strategy
- And use the id after "pub?gid=" as "gid" parameter
- You are ready!

Here is an example of the strategy parameters:

```json
{
  "sheetId": "2PACX-1vTmam7vShzrscNDQ0zy0IC11jJztebhWrK5_5kFT6N_WsEJXDXStmxrOlNmHt9IRf9g7VenegU8vGzh",
