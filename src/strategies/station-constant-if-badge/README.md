# station-constant-if-badge

This strategy returns a constant if a voter/proposer has a specific badge in a [Station](https://www.station.express/) [GroupOS](https://groupos.xyz/) group; If not, zero is returned.

This strategy can be used as a validation strategy that only allows certain members to vote/propose.
